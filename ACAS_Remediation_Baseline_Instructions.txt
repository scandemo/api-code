File: ACAS_Remediation_Baseline_Instructions.txt

Purpose: To provide evaluation instructions for Assured Compliance Assessment
         (ACAS) testing in order to compare the results between vendor's
         recommendations on how to correct vulnerabilities in Container files.

ACAS is a set of information security tools used for vulnerability scanning
and risk assessment used by the United States Department of Defense (DoD).
 
The "API-DownloadMS" folder (demo code) that is provided, serves as the files for
the baseline scans for the ACAS Vulnerability scanning and risk Assessment.
The Operating System (OS) is not included in the scans. All ACAS scans should
use these files for scanning so that the scan results can be compared directly
between all applications from vendors.

I'm enclosing the initial scan report. As I fixed vulnerabilities on a local 
test copy, newer updates showed up for the fixes so I made the changes to 
those as well. I'm also enclosing the final scan results after everything
was remediated.

This is what was performed to correct reported vulnerabilities for the 
demo project files:

    In the "package.jason" file, change: "axios": "^0.21.1", to "axios": "^0.25.0”,
    In the "package.jason" file, change: "mongodb": "^3.6.8", to "mongodb": "^4.2.2”,
    In the "package.jason" file, add:  "ansi-regex": "^6.0.1"

Hopefully you should have the same results with all ACAS scanners being tested.
